        Bungalow Pottery is the ceramics studio of Ken Chin-Purcell, and is
        <a href='/directions'>located</a>
        among the Milton Square shops of Saint Anthony Park in St. Paul, MN.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is both a pottery and a shop that is
        open for purchases while I am working.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work is made from white stoneware and is
        thrown and high fired at the studio.
        My goal is to make pots that you can give or use with pleasure:
        expressive and beautiful.
