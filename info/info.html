          My background is in design, and I think that has led to a fondness of
          edge, curve, arc and function. I favor abstract to naturalistic.
          I like the subtle virtues of
          a good handmade pot, the small undulations and marks of the potter.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a quality to thrown pottery that goes
          well with homemade food and good company. The pots have their own
          individual character that fits the setting. I make my pots with a
          nod towards the shared meals with family and friends that we
          all enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My pots stand up to daily use well, which
          allows them to be decorative at rest and then readily
          employed in the kitchen, at the table,
          or even in the dishwasher.

        <p>My first teacher was Al Clemente Saks, who imprinted on me the throwing basics. I had two other influential teachers, Donovan Palmquist and Shirley Johnson, both of whom are long time Minnesota potters and have worked with Warren MacKenzie. I really took to Donovan's sense of form, and Shirley taught me how to think about and critique pots.</p>
        <p>My first studio was at the Northern Clay Center, where I learned to make pots in the Japanese influenced "Mingei-sota" style. To non-potters this more or less means "rustic brown pots".</p>
        <p>More recently Mark Shapiro gave me some excellent critique and tools to think about pots with.</p>
        <p>The Clayart internet mailing list has been a valuable resource.</p>

          Some Q &amp; A
        </h3>
      </aside>
      <article>
        <p>
          Q: Why pottery?
          <br>
          A: Like many potters, I like the process, the alchemy, working with my hands, making things to be held. Functional pots are a unique form of art in that
          they are frequently touched and have important qualities beyond the visual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: Why white stoneware?
          <br>
          A: It's warmer and more informal than porcelain yet it has good color response and glaze interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: Why high fire?
          <br>
          A: I like interesting glazes, but I want them to look like they are part of the pot. Since more things melt at higher temperatures, it's easier to formulate glazes that interact, or blend, with the clay when you high fire. This produces a softer and deeper look to the glaze. The ware is more durable too, so it can be used in the dishwasher and microwave.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Q: Why an electric kiln?
          <br>
          A: Electric firing results in clearer colors, which after years of muted colors from reduction firings are refreshing to my eye. My kiln though is no longer this shiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: How long does it take for you to make a mug or bowl?
          <br>
          A: Throwing a mug or small bowl takes a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q: That's it?
          <br>
          A: Well, throwing is just part of the process. This is what is involved in making a mug:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wedge (knead) or pug a 25lb bag of clay until it is uniform.</li>
          <li>Portion out 1 lb balls.</li>
          <li>Throw the mug.</li>
          <li>Let the mug dry overnight to "leather hard".</li>
          <li>If the form has a turned foot then put it back on the wheel and trim.</li>
          <li>From wedged clay make a bunch of clay carrots.</li>
          <li>Score, slip and attach carrots to mugs, pull a handle from each carrot.</li>
          <li>Sign or stamp pot.</li>
          <li>Dry completely.</li>
          <li>Load kiln, bisque fire, unload kiln.</li>
          <li>Wax bottom.</li>
          <li>Mix up any glazes that are running low.</li>
          <li>Glaze inside, let dry, wax inside rim, glaze outside, let dry.</li>
          <li>Load kiln, glaze fire, unload kiln.</li>
          <li>Store mug until sold.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In other words, pottery is labor intensive. It makes you appreciate the benefits of mass production.</p>
