I offer a simple registry service for your wedding or other celebraton. 

Guests purchase gift certificates that are specific to the event.
I use the online store section of Square, 
my credit card processor, to handle the money transactions. 
After the event there is a final consultation 
to settle on shape details and glazing, after which I throw and fire the 
pots as a single set. 

The actual production takes about two months, depending on the size of the order and
time of year. I try not to schedule making tableware during the last three months of the year.
